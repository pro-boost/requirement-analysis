# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting and analyzing the software requirements for a Booking Management System as part of the Requirement Analysis Project. The goal is to simulate a real-world development scenario by applying structured methodologies and tools to craft a comprehensive blueprint for the requirement analysis phase.

Through this project, we aim to enhance our understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by focusing on one of its most critical stagesâ€”Requirement Analysis. This includes identifying and categorizing functional and non-functional requirements, developing visual representations using tools like Draw.io, and defining clear acceptance criteria to guide successful project execution.

This repository will serve as a foundation for structured documentation, visual diagrams, and best practices that reflect industry standards in requirement engineering.
